# Limerick Comedy Guide


Limerick Comedy Guide is a website that aims to make it easy for Stand-up Comedy fans in and around Limerick City to keep abreast of the various comedy gig offerings in Limerick City. To accomplish this the site serve as an introduction to the comedy scene in Limerick for those who have a newer or more casual interest in seeing Stand-up. It will also serve as a handy directory for booking links and gig listings across the whole Limerick comedy scene for those who wish to save time looking up the myriad avenues of sourcing the information from traditional sites.

A secondary goal is to support the Comedy Groups, Venues and most importantly Comedians that provide the gigs that users of the site would give their patronage to, given sufficient awareness.


## Features

As of latest version Limerick Comedy Guide is a three page website divided between a home page (index.html) to introduce users to the site and to get straight into highlighting the most pertinent information one would need in general to get comedy fans sitting in front of the stage. This includes;

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

- Featured on all three pages there is a full responsive navigation bar. This includes a home page link on the top logo and three separate button links displayed together at the top of the screen near the logo. These links are; Home page, Comedy-Links and Contact. These are the same on each page for easier more-intuitive navigation.

This feature allows the user to confidently navigate the website and allows the avoidance of using the back button, thereby enhancing the users experience.

Due to varying screen sizes and associated limitations, these buttons will alternate between Icons and text-buttons dynamically depending on the screen width.

- __The landing page Cover Image__

- The initial landing page (index.html) includes a "hero" image, with a cover text. This cover text gives the user a indication of the sites function and hopefully helps to set a more jovial tone given that this is a website revolving around Comedy.

- __Regular Comedy Nights Section__

- The Regular Comedy Nights Section will be the first section the user scrolls down to from the header.
This is due to the desire to prioritize the most key information provided by the site; where one can reliably find comedy gigs within the confines of Limerick City. Given their reliable monthly frequency they are by far the most approachable yet overlooked way to see stand-up comedy in Limerick.

- __Upcoming Gigs Section__

- This section will allow the user to see a curated list of upcoming Comedy Gigs in Limerick, with direct booking links for the user's convienience if they want to book one of the highlighted gigs.

- This section could be updated periodically to keep the content fresh.

- __The Footer__

- The footer section includes (fictional) links to the relevant social media sites for Limerick Comedy Club. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.

- This would hopefully allow the user to keep engaged with the overall Limerick Comedy Guide initative and goals.

- __Comedy Links__

- The Comedy Links Directory page (comedy-links.html) is primarily a curated list of previously disparate links to do with booking and keeping abreast any comedy gigs in Limerick City.

- This section would ideally be bookmarked by users for easy access, whenever they want to peruse what's on in Limerick in the Stand-up/Comedy sphere.

- __The Contact Page__

- This page (contact.html) will allow the user to send a message to Limerick Comedy Guide regarding any comments they may have regarding the site subject or whatever they feel is relevant. This could be used theoretically by fans/comedians to inform the site runner of any gigs/venues that have been overlooked. Could be a inital contact point for businesses to reach out about exposure for their comedy nights etc. Increases potential engagement with the site audience.

### Features Left to Implement

- Possibility to automate some section of the upcoming gig listings sections, sourcing from the linked pages via automated web-scraping script. Can revist with additional python experience etc.

- A media/Gig Videos page - to showcase videos (available youtube clips embedded) and or images from limerick gigs, to enhance audience interest via givnig samples or providing a repository/collection of Limerick Comedy Gigs. Not enough immediately available (/copyright free) media, at present.

## Testing

Primary testing through development process was done via Gitpod python server command to host a browser window of the site. Upon saving changes in gitpod, refreshing the relevant browser window to see updated changes live.

Tested to see that changes reflected design intent.

Resizing browser with CTRL-SHIFT-M on firefox to see responsive-mode.

Inspecting any unexpected or hard to diagnose bugs with the inspect source feature.

Result of testing is confirmation that the site layout adapts as designed dynamically based on the screen size.

Browesers checked with: Firefox Windows(Desktop 1440p), Firefox Mobile on a Samsung A5 2017

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
