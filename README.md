# Limerick Comedy Guide


Limerick Comedy Guide is a website that aims to make it easy for Stand-up Comedy fans in and around Limerick City to keep abreast of the various comedy gig offerings in Limerick City. To accomplish this the site serve as an introduction to the comedy scene in Limerick for those who have a newer or more casual interest in seeing Stand-up. It will also serve as a handy directory for booking links and gig listings across the whole Limerick comedy scene for those who wish to save time looking up the myriad avenues of sourcing the information from traditional sites.

A secondary goal is to support the Comedy Groups, Venues and most importantly Comedians that provide the gigs that users of the site would give their patronage to, given sufficient awareness.


## Features

As of latest version Limerick Comedy Guide is a three page website divided between a home page (index.html) to introduce users to the site and to get straight into highlighting the most pertinent information one would need in general to get comedy fans sitting in front of the stage. This includes;

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

- Featured on all three pages there is a full responsive navigation bar. This includes a home page link on the top logo and three separate button links displayed together at the top of the screen near the logo. These links are; Home page, Comedy-Links and Contact. These are the same on each page for easier more-intuitive navigation.

This feature allows the user to confidently navigate the website and allows the avoidance of using the back button, thereby enhancing the users experience.

Due to varying screen sizes and associated limitations, these buttons will alternate between Icons and text-buttons dynamically depending on the screen width.

- __The landing page Cover Image__

- The initial landing page includes a "hero" image, with a cover text. This cover text gives the user a indication of the sites function and hopefully helps to set a more jovial tone given that this is a website revolving around Comedy.

- __Regular Comedy Nights Section__

- The Regular Comedy Nights Section will be the first section the user scrolls down to from the header.
This is due to the desire to prioritize the most key information provided by the site; where one can reliably find comedy gigs within the confines of Limerick City. Given their reliable monthly frequency they are by far the most approachable yet overlooked way to see stand-up comedy in Limerick.

- This section will allow the user to see exactly when the meetups will happen, where they will be located and how long the run will be in kilometers.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Validator Testing

- HTML

- No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)

- CSS

- No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab

- From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch

- Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
